Some of the steps taken to improve scalability include .. 
1. users cache the channels of the chatrooms once they have joined them avoiding the necessity to query everytime it has to send a message.
2. Leaving a chat room also done using the cached value of the channel. 
3. every user is an independent goroutine
4. Since each user is handled by an independent goroutine which are far more light weight than threads and many goroutines are multiplexed on to the same thread. If a goroutine running on a thread blocks then a new thread is launched run the waiting goroutines.
